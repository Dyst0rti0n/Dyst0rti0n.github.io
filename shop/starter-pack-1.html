Access SSH (Secure Shell) is a critical service that provides remote access to systems. Properly securing SSH is essential for preventing unauthorized access. ## Basic SSH Hardening Steps: 1. Change the default port from 22 to a non-standard port Edit
/etc/ssh/sshd_config: ``` Port 2222 # Choose any unused port between 1024-65535 ``` 2. Disable root login Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config: ``` PermitRootLogin no ``` 3. Use key-based authentication instead of passwords ```bash # On your local machine: ssh-keygen
-t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server ``` Then edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config: ``` PasswordAuthentication no ``` 4. Implement connection throttling with fail2ban ```bash sudo apt install fail2ban sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
/etc/fail2ban/jail.local ``` Edit /etc/fail2ban/jail.local to configure SSH protection: ``` [sshd] enabled = true port = 2222 filter = sshd logpath = /var/log/auth.log maxretry = 3 bantime = 3600 ``` ``` ### Bonus Resources - Access to a private Discord
