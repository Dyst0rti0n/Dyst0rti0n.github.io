Technology has a way of weaving itself into our everyday lives, and with it comes a whole lot of myths that refuse to die. These myths are like the internet’s version of urban legends—stories passed around so often that they become truth in the minds of many. Whether you’re a seasoned techie or just someone who enjoys a good chuckle at the expense of misinformation, let’s take a journey through some of the most stubborn and amusing tech myths still out there. Some of these are absolute crackers and others, so bizarre.

### Myth #1: The Internet is a Cloud

When someone says, “I’m saving this to the cloud,” do they picture fluffy white clouds floating in the sky holding onto their precious data? If so, we’re here to burst that bubble (or cloud). The “cloud” isn’t some ethereal realm where your files are suspended in the sky—it’s just someone else’s server farm, probably in a massive, unremarkable data center in a secure (hopefully) data center owned by companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft; in the middle of nowhere

**Why It Exists:** The metaphor of the cloud makes it easier for people to grasp the concept of remote storage. It’s much more comforting to think of your photos floating in a serene cloud rather than sitting on a cold, metallic server rack.

### Myth #2: Refreshing Your Browser Speeds Up the Internet

Raise your hand if you’ve ever hit that refresh button like it was going to turbocharge your internet connection. Refreshing a page might feel like you’re giving your internet a caffeine boost, but in reality, it’s more like telling your browser to take the scenic route again—at the same speed.

**Why It Exists:** The refresh button gives us a sense of control, like we’re doing something to fix the problem. It’s the digital equivalent of kicking a malfunctioning machine to see if it starts working.

### Myth #3: Wi-Fi Signals Cause Cancer

Here’s a myth that’s been making the rounds for years, spreading fear faster than a viral tweet. Some people believe that Wi-Fi signals or 5G can cause cancer or other serious health issues. I've personally had some arguments with people over this issue.

Wi-Fi signals are a type of non-ionizing radiation, which means they don’t have enough energy to damage your DNA or cause cancer. The same goes for your phone’s radio waves. Extensive research has found no credible evidence linking Wi-Fi or phones to cancer.

**Why It Exists:** This myth persists because of general fear and misunderstanding of radiation. The word “radiation” sounds scary, even though it’s a broad term that includes harmless things like the light from your lamp.

### Myth #4: More Megapixels Mean Better Photos

Ah, the megapixel myth—the bane of every photographer’s existence. You might think that the more megapixels a camera has, the better the photos will be. But just as more horsepower doesn’t automatically make a car faster, more megapixels don’t necessarily mean better pictures.

While megapixels determine the resolution of an image, they’re not the only factor in photo quality. Sensor size, lens quality, and image processing all play crucial roles in producing a good photo. A camera with a lower megapixel count but a better sensor can easily outshoot a higher-megapixel camera with a poor sensor.

**Why It Exists:** Camera manufacturers have long used megapixels as a simple, easy-to-understand number to market their products. It’s a convenient selling point, even if it doesn’t tell the whole story.

### Myth #5: Macs Don’t Get Viruses

Yes, we’re revisiting this one because it’s that persistent. The myth that Macs are immune to viruses is like thinking Superman doesn’t need to sleep—great in theory, but not true in the real world.

Macs can and do get viruses, though they’re less common than on Windows PCs. As macOS has grown in popularity, so has the attention from hackers. While the system has robust security features, no computer is completely immune. Your Mac might have a fancy suit of armor, but it’s not made of kryptonite. Keep that antivirus software up to date.

**Why It Exists:** For years, Macs were less targeted because there were fewer of them, and Windows was the dominant operating system. As a result, people started to believe that Macs were somehow invincible.

### Myth #6: The Dark Web is a Place of Pure Evil

When people hear “Dark Web,” they often think of a shadowy underworld where criminals lurk around every corner. While it’s true that illegal activities happen there, the Dark Web is also home to legitimate uses, like privacy-focused forums, secure communication channels for journalists, and even libraries.

The Dark Web is just a part of the internet that isn’t indexed by traditional search engines. It’s a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad. Many people use the Dark Web to protect their privacy, access censored information, or communicate securely.

**Why It Exists:** The Dark Web has a reputation for being shady because of the illegal activities that take place there, but that’s only one aspect of it. The media often sensationalises these elements, feeding the myth.

### Conclusion

Technology myths are like urban legends—they stick around because they’re simple, easy to understand, and often comforting. Next time you hear someone spouting one of these myths, you can smile and nod knowing the truth.
