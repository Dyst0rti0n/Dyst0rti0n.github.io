## Chapter 1: Introduction to Blockchain

### Lesson 1.1: Understanding Blockchain Basics
**Objective**: Understand what blockchain technology is and its key components.

**Content**:
- **Definition of Blockchain**: A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Blocks**: Containers that hold batches of transactions.
  - **Chains**: A series of blocks linked together using cryptographic hashes.
  - **Nodes**: Computers participating in the blockchain network, maintaining copies of the ledger.
  - **Decentralization**: The distribution of the blockchain ledger across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central authority.

**Practical Task**: Research and write a blog post on the basic concepts of blockchain.

### Lesson 1.2: The History and Evolution of Blockchain
**Objective**: Learn about the origin and evolution of blockchain technology.

**Content**:
- **The History of Blockchain**:
  - **Bitcoin**: Introduced by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. It was the first successful implementation of blockchain technology.
  - **Ethereum**: Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, introducing smart contracts.
  - **Key Milestones and Developments**:
    - 2008: Bitcoin whitepaper published.
    - 2009: Bitcoin network launched.
    - 2015: Ethereum network launched.
    - Subsequent advancements like DeFi, NFTs, and various blockchain forks and improvements.

**Practical Task**: Create a timeline of blockchain development and significant events.

### Lesson 1.3: Blockchain Terminology
**Objective**: Familiarize yourself with common blockchain terminology.

**Content**:
- **Glossary of Blockchain Terms**:
  - **Hash**: A function that converts input data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code.
  - **Mining**: The process by which transactions are verified and added to the blockchain.
  - **Consensus**: Agreement among distributed nodes on the state of the blockchain.
  - **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

**Practical Task**: Create a glossary of terms and provide examples.
